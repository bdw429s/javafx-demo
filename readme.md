# JavaFX Demo

This CommandBox module is a proof of concept to launch a cross-platform compatible native JavaFX app from the CLI.

After installing the module, run
```
javafx-demo
```
from the CommandBox shell.  It will download JDK 17 and the JavaFX libraries the first time and then launch the demo app found here:
